 * A range query that returns a constant score equal to its boost for

 * It does not have an upper bound on the number of clauses covered in the range.
 * <p>
 * If an endpoint is null, it is said to be "open".
 * Either or both endpoints may be open.  Open endpoints may not be exclusive
 * (you can't select all but the first or last term without explicitly specifying the term to exclude.)
