   * Interface for a Solr trigger. Each trigger implements Runnable and Closeable interface. A trigger

   * per a configured schedule to check whether the trigger is ready to fire. The {@link #setListener(TriggerListener)}
   * method should be used to set a callback listener which is fired by implementation of this class whenever
   * ready.
   * <p>
   * As per the guarantees made by the {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} a trigger
   * implementation is only ever called sequentially and therefore need not be thread safe. However, it
   * is encouraged that implementations be immutable with the exception of the associated listener
   * which can be get/set by a different thread than the one executing the trigger. Therefore, implementations
   * should use appropriate synchronization around the listener.
   * <p>
   * When a trigger is ready to fire, it calls the {@link TriggerListener#triggerFired(TriggerEvent)} event
   * with the proper trigger event object. If that method returns false then it should be interpreted to mean
   * that Solr is not ready to process this trigger event and therefore we should retain the state and fire
   * at the next invocation of the run() method.
